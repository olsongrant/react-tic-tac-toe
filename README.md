# react-tic-tac-toe

This repository contains the results of my efforts to convert (React) class components to function components. I did this work as an exercise in the process of learning React.

The original tic-tac-toe solution, based on class components, can be found at [https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010).  This solution is referenced by the tutorial at [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

The process for getting it running in one's local computing environment:
1. follow the instructions for setting up the local development environment at [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment) (unfold it to see the instructions), **but**
2. instead of using the `src/index.js` file indicated by the tutorial, use the one in this repository.
The `src/index.css` file in this repository is not changed from the original at [https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0100](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0100).  

Essentially, I've pushed the only two files that are required to be in the `src` directory for this app to work. So if you use create-react-app to establish a new application, just replace the `src` folder contents with those from this repository.
